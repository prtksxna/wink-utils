> Javascript Functions for Machine Learning, Statistics, Text Mining, and more.

**wink-utils** is one of the building blocks of [_decisively_](https://github.com/decisively) â€” a framework for fast in-memory analytics. The work to open source _decisively_ is underway. **wink-utils** provides a rich set of functions to build scalable NodeJS applications using streams and multi-processing. They contain near zero syntactic sugar. 

It has the following categories of functions: 

1. Text Preparation
2. Similarity Detection 
3. Naive Bayes Classifier
4. Clustering
5. Basic Statistics
6. Validations
